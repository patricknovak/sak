-- The second-chance bracket (docs/POOL-TYPES.md §9 item 4, "the bracket with a second chance"): once a pool's bracket
-- has locked, the host can open another on the same event from a later round (March Madness' Sweet 16, the NHL's second
-- round), so a busted bracket isn't the end. It is a bracket like the first, named "Second-chance bracket", on the
-- scoreboard beside it. The game list sends each game's first round and whether it has locked, so the host's desk
-- offers it.
