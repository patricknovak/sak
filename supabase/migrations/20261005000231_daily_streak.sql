-- The daily streak (docs/POOL-TYPES.md §9 item 7): a `pool_games` kind ('streak') on any event with games, a postseason
-- or a season of rounds. Each day there are games, a member picks the winner of one of them (`pool_picks` thing
-- 'd:<the game's day, Eastern>', the pick {fixture, pick}); a right pick adds one to the run, a wrong one starts it
-- again, and a day off or a game called off breaks nothing. The longest run wins it, the run going now breaks a tie.
-- * A day's pick changes until its game starts, and can move to any game that day still to come.
-- * Results as the pool reads them (`_pool_fixture`: the host's word before the feed's), worked out on read.
-- * Offered on every event with a game still to come (`pool_event_list`), reminded before each day's first game
--   (`_pool_game_nudge`), and on the scoreboard as "Best run 4, 2 now" (`_pool_rows`).
-- Safe to run twice.
