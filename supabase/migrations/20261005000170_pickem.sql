-- Weekly pick'em (docs/DEVELOPMENT.md §6 item 1, docs/POOL-TYPES.md §2.4): the first kind of pool game built on
-- `fixtures` rather than `series`, so it runs on any competition whose matches come in rounds: soccer's matchweeks
-- today, the NFL's weeks the day its feed lands.
--
-- * Each round, pick the winner of every match (or a draw, in a sport that has them). Each pick locks at its own
--   kick-off, so a late joiner still plays every match left.
-- * Classic: a right pick is a point. Confidence: number each round's picks from 1 to the number of matches, your
--   surest highest; a right pick earns its number.
-- * Points, what is still possible and right calls are worked out on read from `fixtures`, so a corrected result
--   corrects every table at once. The pool hears each round's winner when its last match ends, and the game's winner
--   after its last round. A reminder goes out a few hours before a round's first kick-off to anyone with matches to
--   pick. The scoreboard (migration 169) reads it like every other kind.
-- * The start page's list of events grows the competitions with rounds (`pool_event_list`); `pool_events` stays as the
--   site before pick'em reads it, to retire once that site is gone.
